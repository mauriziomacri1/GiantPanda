        <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

        <p>The GIANT PANDA [5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central
            China. It
            is characterised by large,
            black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.</p>
        <p>The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. </p>
        <p>it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up
            more
            than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even
            meat in the form of birds,
            rodents, or carrion.></p>
        <p>In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with
            specially
            prepared food.</p>
        <p>The GIANT PANDA lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring
            Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been
            driven out of the lowland
            areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[11][12] A 2007 report showed
            239 pandas living in
            captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in
            captivity outside China,
            living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[14] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that
            there are about 1,590
            individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as
            high as 2,000 to 3,000.Some reports
            also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news site
            Mongabay stated
            that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN
            reclassified the species from
            "endangered" to "vulnerable", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda.</p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>

        <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, 
            consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[45] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, 
            as well as carnivore-specific genes,[49] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. 
            Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[50][51] Pandas are born with sterile intestines 
            and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[52] The giant panda is a highly specialised 
            animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.[53]</p>
